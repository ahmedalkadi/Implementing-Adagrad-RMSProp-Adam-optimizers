# Implementation of (Adagrad, RMSProp, Adam) optimizers:
## Introduction
This practical work involves developing a Python program to implement accelerated gradient descent methods with adaptive learning rates, specifically Adagrad, RMSProp, and Adam, for linear regression of a set of data points. These algorithms aim to optimize the learning process by dynamically adjusting the learning rate based on the gradients of the loss function, leading to faster convergence and improved performance.

## Objective
The main objective of this practical work is to implement and compare the performance of Adagrad, RMSProp, and Adam optimization algorithms for single-variable linear regression. By applying these algorithms, students will gain hands-on experience in understanding and implementing adaptive learning rate methods in the context of linear regression.

## Implementation Details
- Language: Python
- Algorithms: Adagrad, RMSProp, Adam
- Task: Single-variable linear regression
